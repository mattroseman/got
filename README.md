git implementation in go.

Following git documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain), try and recreate it using go.

Not intended to be used as version control software by any means. This is built for fun and learning purposes.
For a real implementation of git in golang, checkout [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git)
